Remember to add a "RUN" button to the GUI prototype. Otherwise how do you even run all of the files?

  Include some examples of the three different blurs: fast_blur, accurate_blur, and the blur algorithm used in Java.
  Perhaps include a few examples. Some that show sharp edges, etc. Get some images with very different content in them.
  fast_blur is the same as the classic algorithm, blending between multiple images. currently it just does 2 images,
  but the java one does (20 I think?). Any number can be selected.
  ***See the folder "blur comparison"***

  What are the things she wants in regards to on-the-fly editing of the heatmap/image?
  (Heatmap adjusting is not in yet, but should be fairly quick to implement.)

luminance level

Degree of Visual Angle
- see which parts of the image would be blurry based on the person's vision, based on the size of the screen and the distance from the screen


**TODO**
- Look at the code that LouAnne sent me
- compare fade-to-color (with black) vs fade luminance
- add attributes to the gui
- allow scrubbing through all loaded images/heatmaps in the gui
- make "remove" button remove only the selected filter
- add a venv or some sort of project file, so that numpy, opencv, PIL, etc. are either included in the download
    or else automatically downloaded when the program is run
- make the image generation be asynchronous
- make sure that images/heatmaps/save location are all selected before pressing run
